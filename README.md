# ArduinoDistance



This project implements sensor fusion techniques to enhance proximity estimation accuracy using an Arduino Nano 33 BLE, combining infrared and ultrasonic sensors. It includes sensor fusion algorithms, tilt compensation using the onboard IMU, and optimized sensor readings for real-time applications in varying environments.

The code calculates distances while addressing tilt and surface color issues, and features detailed implementation of interrupts, I2C communication, and analog-to-digital conversion.
